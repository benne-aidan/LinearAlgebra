# LinearAlgebra
C library to solve common Linear Algebra problems. Contains datatype `Matrix`, which stores elements in single dimensional dynamically allocated arrays. Easy access of indices from row/column notation is acheived with `Matrix_elementAt` function. As of current implementation, vectors are simply Nx1 or 1xN matrices.

Algorithms are written to reflect standard methods of solving problems by hand, rather than for optimization.

`UI.c` contains example implementation of library with text-based UI.
